2a) The goal of this problem is to recover the clean image (a) from a noisy input (b). Of
course, we cannot recover (a) exactly since information has been lost in the noise. The
graphical model we use is a pairwise MRF as shown in (c). A pixel has four neighbors.
We are going to use Markov Random Frields (MRFs) to model the distribution of nat-
ural images and restore the clean image given an noisy input image.

2b) The goal of this problem is to once again recover the clean image (a) from a noisy
input (b), now in the famous picture of Lena, which is used to benchmark many image
processing algorithms. Of course, we cannot recover (a) exactly since information has
been lost in the noise. The graphical model we use is a pairwise MRF as shown in (c).
A pixel has four neighbors.

all the matlab files are attached on the code folder

for part 2a - run "hw_5mrf.m"
it displays the images as well as the accuracy of the code

for part 2b - run "hw5B.m"
is displays the 2 images of lena as well
